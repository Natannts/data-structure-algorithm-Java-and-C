# data-structure-algorithm-Java-and-C
In my Algorithms and Data Structures course, I developed a project that scrapes TV series data from Wikipedia HTML pages. The project extracts and filters series names, languages, formats, durations, countries, networks, airing dates, seasons, and episodes. I applied my algorithm and data structure knowledge to efficiently process this data.
